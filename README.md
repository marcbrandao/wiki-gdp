# Last Checkpoint: 23:14 BRT 7 Jan - Notes for the whole slice [:60]

    # [Corrected and Resolved]:
        # Switzerland had US$ nominal instead of US$nominal UPDATE: corrected by including variation in the code
        # France: had hierarchized headers, corrected.
        # Finland: only had EUR values instead of Bil US$ #Not solved for PPP (solved only for Nominal GDP yet, PPP to be added)
        # Phillipines: years are shown as th instead of td, years had special characters in it
        # Pakistan: years are show as th instead of td
            # Adapted the code to accept year as just the 4 first characters of the cell [Phillipines fix]
            # Adapted the code to accept year as being a th too, not just td [th year fix]
                # Created a rows cells table composed of any th cells if they are classified as such instead of as td.
